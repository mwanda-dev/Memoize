    // @State in a view is gonna cause a variable to come into existence as soon as the view is displayed, but it it taken away as soon as the view is taken away.
    // @ObservedObject causes the lifetime to come from somewhere else, where it is passed in from.

                // Dictionaries don't allow duplicate values, so we need another way to uniquely identify the cards rendered.
                // Since we have removed the 'id: \.self,' we now need the 'MemoGame<String>.Card' to conform to 'Identifiable'

// The preview is getting recreated every time we touch our code. That's why the cards get reset everytime.
// This closure creates a new View everytime so we wouldn't want something like this in our app to cause leaks.
